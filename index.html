<p><em><strong>Friday, February 28, 2020</strong></em></p>
<p>So here is the situation, over that past week I have slowly been adding
a fewfeatures that one would find in a real application. as of the moment
those features have been</p>
<ul>
<li>1: A mongodb database</li>
<li>2: Containerization with docker</li>
</ul>
<p>originally whenever I would want to rebuild my container,
I would run <em><strong><code>bins/rebuildDb.bash</code></strong></em>, it would</p>
<ol>
<li>stop the server</li>
<li>rebuild it</li>
<li>restart it</li>
</ol>
<p>Now what I wanted to do was find a system so that I was not creating a
container from my local system but instead from my git repository</p>
<p>The only issue is that my application pulls environment variables
from a <code>.env</code> file that is not present in the repository(for
security reasons)</p>

<p>Finding a secure way I can pass the environment variables to my program
while not comprising all of my tokens and connection strings</p>
